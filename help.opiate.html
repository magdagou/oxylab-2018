<h2>OPIATE WITHDRAWAL, SYMPTOMS, AND TREATMENT</h2>
<h3>
    Signs of Opiate Withdrawal<br></h3>
    <h7>Opiate withdrawal symptoms may range from mild to severe, depending on how dependent the individual is on an opioid drug. Dependency can be directly tied to the length of time taking a particular drug, dosage amount, which drug was taken, how the drug was taken, underlying medical conditions, the co-occurring presence of a mental health issue, and certain biological and environmental factors, such as family history of addiction, previous trauma, or highly stressful and unsupportive surroundings. Withdrawal from an opioid drug may roughly adhere to the following timeline, although it can vary from person to person.<br>

<h3>Early Withdrawal Symptoms<br></h3>

    <h7>These usually start within 6-12 hours for short-acting opiates, and they start within 30 hours for longer-acting ones:<br>
    Tearing up<br>
    Muscle aches<br>
    Agitation<br>
    Trouble falling and staying asleep<br>
    Excessive yawning<br>
    Anxiety<br>
    Nose running<br>
    Sweats<br>
    Racing heart<br>
    Hypertension<br>
    Fever<br></h7>

<h3>Late Withdrawal Symptoms<br></h3>
    <h7>These peak within 72 hours and usually last a week or so:<br>

    Nausea and vomiting<br>
    Diarrhea<br>
    Goosebumps<br>
    Stomach cramps<br>
    Depression<br>
    Drug cravings<br>
    Some of the psychological withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opioid drugs may continue longer than a week in some cases. Therapy and psychological support provided by a mental health professional as a part of a complete substance abuse treatment program can decrease the symptoms and side effects of withdrawal.<br>

<h3>Detox Options</h3>
<h7>There are several treatment and detox options for the removal of opioids from the body, and some may provide a more comprehensive model than others. Medical detox, for instance, encompasses both pharmacological and psychological treatment methodologies while under close supervision of both medical and mental health specialists in a safe and comforting residential setting, while standard detox may be performed in an outpatient basis.Opiate withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, and medical detox may provide the safest and smoothest way to detox. Vital signs, such as blood pressure, respiration levels, body temperature, and heart rate, can all be closely monitored in a medical detox center that may utilize medications to regulate brain and body functions.
</h7>
<br>
<h7>
    Mental health professionals can also evaluate and stabilize individuals during medical detox. While there is no specific timeline for detox, as each individual will likely experience withdrawal from opiates differently, medical detox usually lasts 5-7 days.</h7>
<br>

<h3> Medical Detox</h3>
<br>
<h7>Opioid drugs should not be stopped suddenly, without physical and emotional support and supervision, as the side effects of withdrawal may be powerful and even have dangerous complications.
</h7>
<br>
<h7>Medications, such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and other symptom-specific pharmaceuticals, may be useful during medical detox to control the more difficult withdrawal symptoms.
</h7>
<br>
<h7>Medical professionals may help an individual wean off opioid drugs by slowly lowering, or tapering, the dosage during medical detox. This keeps the opioid receptors filled and prevents the onset of severe withdrawal symptoms. Drug cravings and withdrawal as a whole may be managed by replacing a short-acting opioid like heroin with a longer-acting one such as methadone. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist often used during opioid detox and dependency treatment as well, as it remains active in the body for longer than most opioids and requires a lower dosage amount. Partial agonists also do not usually create the same “high” as full agonists do, therefore making them less likely to be abused. Buprenorphine even stops being effective after a certain point, further acting as an abuse deterrent.
</h7>
<br>
<h7>Naloxone and naltrexone are opioid antagonists that bind to opioid receptor sites along the central nervous system and “block” other opioids from filling them. This means that even if someone tries to take a drug like heroin while on an antagonist, the drug will not produce the desired effects and instead may cause a precipitated withdrawal syndrome to start. Precipitated withdrawal is the sudden and rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms, which can be intense and can serve to keep someone on an antagonist from attempting to abuse an opioid agonist at the same time.
</h7>
<br>
<h7>Naloxone is added to buprenorphine as an inactive relapse-prevention agent in drugs like Suboxone and Zubsolv unless the drugs are altered and then abused via injection. Naltrexone products like ReVia, Depade, and Vivitrol are used more commonly to help prevent relapse after detox is completed and opioid drugs are fully removed from the brain and body. The intention of detox is to stabilize an individual dependent on opioids both emotionally and physically, and detox may use both pharmacological and psychological therapy methods to accomplish this.</h7>
